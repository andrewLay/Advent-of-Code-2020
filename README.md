# Advent-of-Code-2020

ADVENT OF CODE 2020 CONSOLE APPLICATION
=======================================
Everyday from December 1st - 25th, coding challenges are released at https://adventofcode.com/2020.
Each day's challenge is composed of two problems to be solved sequentially. 
Day X.2 is slightly harder than Day X.1, but related. 
This console application issues calls to the solutions of the daily challenges (Day 0.0 Selenium Web Driver.cs).
The solutions are written as C# files, C++ DLLs, and Python scripts.
This application automates logins to the website using GitHub credentials, and web scrapes the puzzle input (HTML) using Selenium Webdriver.
This application communicates with C++ DLLs using interop services and with Python scripts using IronPython hosting.
